# Logistics-Backend
This project is the basic implementation of an API for user registration and supplier information, carried out as a technical test.

The project has 2 APIs:
- User/Api: which contains operations for user management
- Supplier.Api: which contains the operations allowed for supplier management

The project requires a local mongo db database to be able to run, and within it to create a database. Place the authentication credentials in the appsetings file.
